## How To Contribute :rocket:


Hello! :wave: 

Thank you for considering contributing to `superduperdb`. There are many ways to contribute, and they are not limited to writing code. We welcome all contributions such as:

- bug reports
- documentation improvements
- enhancement suggestions
- expanding the tutorials and examples

This project is intended to be a community effort, and it won't be possible without your support and enthusiasm.

## Where to Start? :boom:
If you're new to open-source development, we recommend going through the GitHub ‚Äúissues‚Äù tab to find items that interest you. Once you‚Äôve found something interesting, the next step is to create your development environment.

We follow something called a "fork and pull request" workflow for collaborating on our project. See [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) for a great overview on what some of these mysterious terms mean! 

Once you've 'forked' the code, please follow these steps:
```
cd /path/to/my/work/folder  # change location to where you do you work
```
```
python3 -m venv .venv  # create your Python virtual environment
```
```
. .venv/bin/activate  # activate the Python virtual environment
```
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip-tools  # install pip-tools
```
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.in  # install the Python environment
```
```
python3 -m pip install -e .  # Install the superduperdb project in editable mode
```

The final steps to creating a development environment involve installing [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Once you get this far, you are all set to start contributing - ship it! :shipit:

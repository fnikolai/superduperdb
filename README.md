# Welcome to SuperDuperDB!

> An AI-database management system for the full PyTorch model-development lifecycle

Full documentation [here](https://superduperdb.github.io/superduperdb).

## Installation

Requires:

- MongoDB
- RedisDB

Then install the python requirements

## Contributing

SuperDuperDB is in *alpha*. Please expect:

- breaking changes
- rough edges
- fast pace of new feature development

If you'd like to contribute to the project we need help in many places:

- Trying out the features and commenting on the issues boards
- Adding additional unittests and doctests
- Augmenting doc-strings to make the usage patterns clearer for the uninitiated
- Expanding the documentation, tutorials and examples
